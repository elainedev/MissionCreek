<div id="heading">Birds of Mission Creek</div>

<p> Birds that live along Mission Creek are diverse and abundant.  Birds of Prey are the most abundant along the foothills where they search for rodents who live in the grasslands. Hundreds of Turkey Vultures can be seen soaring on the wind currents. Songbirds jump from tree to tree and provide background music as you walk along Mission Creek.  Water Birds are not as abundant because the creek does not provide enough pools for food or shelter, but they occasionally stop by as they fly from Lake Elizabeth, Tyson Lagoon, Quarry Lakes, and the San Francisco Bay. </p>
