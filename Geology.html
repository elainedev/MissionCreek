        <section class ="section fluid">
        <p>Mission Creek dissects 5 geologic units including the Briones Formation (Miocene), the Tice Shale (Miocene), the chert and siliceous shale member of the Claremont Formation (Miocene), older alluvial fan deposits (Pleistocene), and flood basin deposits (Holocene). A “formation” is a geologic term that includes rocks that were deposited under similar conditions over a large area. Erosion occurs predominantly in the hills where the Briones Formation, Claremont Formation, and the Tice shale are exposed, but erosion also occurs in the older alluvial fan deposits.  Sedimentation occurs further down the creek in the flood plain deposits and in Lake Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Mission Creek is located within the area covered by the Niles and La Costa 7.5-Minutes Quadrangles, which are maps produced by the U.S. Geological Survey. Thomas Dibblee completed the first preliminary geologic maps in 1980.   Graymer, et al (1994), in his preliminary geologic map of the Niles 7.5 Minutes Quadrangle did not assign a name to the Cretaceous sediments,  but  correlated the Miocene sediments with those found further north in the Berkeley area and assigned them the unit and formation names common in the Berkeley Hills. The aerial extent of the geologic units in Graymer’s map differs little from Dibblee’s in the Mission Creek area.  His descriptions of the map units are more detailed and show some differences to Dibblee’s. The interpretation of the structure in the area is also interpreted differently. While Dibblee recognizes a syncline (Niles Syncline) and an anticline in the Cretaceous and Miocene sandstone units,  Graymer sees them as faults, the Sheridan Creek fault and the Dresser Fault/Mill Creek Fault respectively. Dibblee interprets the layers of Miocene sandstones between Mission fault and the anticline northeast of Mission Fault as being overturned and dipping northeast. Graymer sees these layers as just dipping to the northeast between Mission Fault and Mill Creek Fault. Below is a summary of the units of Graymer, et al (1994).  The codes can help you find them on the simplified geologic map on this page.</p>

<img src="MC images/geology.gif" alt="" id= "map" class="floatRight"/>
<p><b> UNNAMED (Holocene)</b><i> (QTig, Qhaf, Qhb, Qhf, Qhsc, Qls) </i>
<br>Organic-rich clay to very fine silty-clay deposits occupying the lowest topographic position either between the Holocene levee deposits or Holocene flood plain deposits.</p>

<p><b>UNNAMED  (Pleistocene)</b><i> (Qpaf) </i>
<br>Tan to reddish brown, dense, gravel to clay sands or clayey gravel that grades upward to sandy clay.</p>

<p><b>BRIONES FORMATION  (late Miocene)</b><i> (Tbu) </i><br>The basal part of this formation consists of distinctly bedded, gray to white fine-grained sandstone and siltstone. Bedding is parallel and cross-beds are not evident. Sandstone beds are as thin as 5 to 10 cm with 2 to 10 cm thick shaly interbeds. These are interbedded with massive fine-grained sandstone beds as much as 5 meters thick. The middle part of the formation (shell beds) consists of indistinctly-bedded, white, fine to coarse-grained sandstone, conglomeratic sandstone, and massive, shell-hash conglomerate. Shell-hash conglomerate is made up of marine mollusk shells in a white calcareous sandstone matrix. Pebble and cobble conglomerate beds are present in a few places. Conglomeratic clasts include black chert, red chert, quartzite, andesite, argillite, siltstone, basalt, felsic tuff, and vein quartz. The shell beds and conglomerates are hard and resistant and form prominent ledges, ridges and peaks such as Mission Peak. The upper portion of the formation consists of distinctly indistinctly-bedded, massive to cross-bedded, fine to coarse-grained light colored sandstone. Sand grains are predominantly quartz and feldspar.</p>

<p><b>CLAREMONT FORMATION</b><i> (middle to late Miocene) (Tcc, Tcs) </i><br>
Chert occurs as distinct, massive, gray beds as much as 10 cm thick with thin (about 1 to 2 mm) shale partings. Chert forms about 30 % of the member in the Niles quadrangle. Siliceous shale is dark brown to gray, finely laminated, with grains ranging from clay to silt size.</p> </section>
