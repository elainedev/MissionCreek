<div id="heading">Mammals of Mission Creek</div>

<p> Throughout the Mission Creek Watershed you can find many urban animals that use the creek for water. Wild mammals have changed throughout the history of Mission Creek, but many of the smaller mammals like shrews, voles, moles, and gophers were around before settlers came to this area. </p>

        <p><b>California Ground Squirrel</b><br>
        <img src="MC images/groundsqu.jpg" alt="" class="floatRight"/> The tail of the ground squirrel is shorter and less bushy than the tree squirrels.  As its name implies, it likes to remain on the ground, but is also a good climber. It stores great amounts of food in its burrow.   It stays closes to their burrows and sits up on their haunches to see over the area.  It is noted for sounding an alarm on top of its burrow to warn other squirrels.  Its alarm is a loud chirp at regular intervals.</p></section>

<section class="section fluid" >
        <p><b>Eastern Grey Squirrel</b><br>
        <img src="MC images/squirrel.jpg" alt="" class="floatRight"/>This squirrel has fairly large, rounded, erect ears.  Its tail is long, flattened, and bushy. It has internal cheek pockets and 20 teeth.  They are gray to brownish gray with a reddish-brown highlight.  Under part is gray or buff. Mainly eats seeds, but known to eat berries, fungus, bark, sap, and insects.  Lives in hollow trees or nests.   It is an excellent climber but spends as much time foraging on the ground.   As most squirrels, it uses its tail to help balance as it travels on tree limbs.</p></section>

        <section class="section fluid" >
        <p><b>Eastern Fox Squirrel</b><br>
        <img src="MC images/easternFoxSquirrel.jpg" alt="" class="floatRight"/>This squirrel is a medium-sized tree squirrel, rusty to reddish gray across back.   It has 3 main color phases including rusty, gray and black. It is the largest of the North American tree squirrels. It weighs 1.6 -2.4 pounds and eats acorns, walnuts, and  other types of seeds.    Its foreprint has 4 toes while the hindprint has 5 toes.  This squirrel is diurnal, but not as agile in the trees as the  western gray squirrel.  Their lifespan is 6 -10 years.</p></section>



<section class ="section fluid">
<p>
<b>Gopher</b>
<br><img src="MC images/gopher.jpg" alt=""class="floatRight"/>Long claws on the forefeet and heavy shoulder muscles make gophers superb diggers. They carry food in fur-lined pouches on either side of their mouth.  A furry membrane behind the incisors keeps dirt out of the mouth while the gopher is digging. The earth mounds that are pushed out during the gophersâ€™ search for food have a distinct earthen plug at the center or the side.  Gophers plow the land and bring tons of soil to the surface each year, stimulating plants to grow larger and healthier. Pocket gophers are solitary except during the breeding season and usually expel intruders from their burrow system.   However, abandoned gopher burrows often provide essential refuge for a variety of other animals. Gophers are prey for hawks, owls, fox, cats and snakes. </p>
